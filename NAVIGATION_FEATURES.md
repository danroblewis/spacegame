### ü§ñ Auto-pilot
- **Description**: Automated navigation with fuel optimization
- **Features**:
  - Follows planned routes automatically
  - Real-time progress tracking
  - Can be stopped/paused
  - Error handling for failed navigation
- **Usage**: Start/stop buttons in NavigationPanel after planning route

## üéÆ User Interface

### Map Component Enhancements
- Quick jump and warp buttons in ship controls

- **Route Planning**: Multi-waypoint route creation and optimization
- **Autopilot**: Automated navigation controls
- **Help Section**: Comprehensive feature documentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Backend Enhancements (`main.py`)
- Added new Pydantic models: `JumpRequest`, `WarpRequest`, `RouteRequest`
- Implemented new API endpoints:
  - `/api/ships/{ship_symbol}/jump`
  - `/api/ships/{ship_symbol}/warp`
  - `/api/ships/{ship_symbol}/cooldown`
  - `/api/ships/{ship_symbol}/route`
  - `/api/ships/{ship_symbol}/emergency-stop`
- Mock data support for demo mode
- Error handling and validation

### Frontend Components
- **NavigationPanel.js**: New comprehensive navigation interface
- **NavigationPanel.css**: Space-themed styling with modern UI elements
- **Map.js**: Enhanced with quick navigation buttons
- **Map.css**: Additional styles for navigation buttons
- **Fleet.js**: Integrated NavigationPanel component

## üé® Design Features
- Space-themed color scheme with gradients
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Real-time status updates
- Visual feedback for all actions
- Accessibility considerations
- Modern UI with smooth animations

## üîß Usage Instructions

### Basic Navigation
1. Select a ship in the Fleet view
2. Ensure ship is in orbit for most navigation actions
3. Use the Map to click on waypoints for local navigation
4. Use NavigationPanel for advanced features

### Jump Travel
1. Ensure ship is in orbit
2. Enter destination waypoint symbol
3. Click "Jump" - antimatter will be auto-purchased
4. Wait for cooldown to complete

### Warp Travel
1. Ensure ship has warp drive module
2. Ensure ship is in orbit
3. Enter destination waypoint symbol
4. Click "Warp" - fuel will be consumed

### Route Planning
1. Add waypoints using "Add Waypoint" button
2. Enter waypoint symbols for each destination
3. Choose fuel optimization preference
4. Click "Plan Route" to calculate
5. Review fuel and time estimates

### Autopilot
1. Plan a route first
2. Click "Start Autopilot"
3. Monitor progress in real-time
4. Stop manually if needed
