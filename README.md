## Getting Started

### Configuration

This project uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash

# Optional: API Base URL (defaults to https://api.spacetraders.io/v2)
SPACETRADERS_API_URL=https://api.spacetraders.io/v2
